/* ==========================================================================
   The share dialog.

   WHY IT EXISTS AT ALL. Sharing used to be one row inside Settings, under
   a hamburger, three levels from the canvas. Someone who has just built
   something and wants to send it to a friend does not go looking in
   Settings, so the feature may as well not have shipped. It is now a
   labelled button in the top bar, because "send this to someone" is a
   thing people want to do often and a thing this project wants them to do.

   WHY A DIALOG RATHER THAN COPYING ON CLICK. Copying silently is fine
   when there is nothing to say. There is something to say here: the link
   goes through a store, and the design is encrypted before it does. A
   reader is entitled to see that before they hand a URL to someone, and
   the dialog is the only place to say it without a tooltip nobody reads.

   WHY OPENING THE DIALOG DOES NOT BUILD THE LINK. Two reasons, and the
   second is the one that matters. Opening a dialog to read what it says
   is not consent to upload the design, and a store write is the one
   moment a design leaves the browser. It is also the one irreversible
   thing here: a stored blob cannot be unstored, so it should follow a
   deliberate click rather than a curious one. The cost is real too,
   since every look would otherwise spend a write out of the day's
   budget for a link nobody ever sends.

   WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. No expiry picker, no "who can view",
   no account. The store cannot read a design and has no idea who made it,
   so there is nothing to configure that would mean anything.
